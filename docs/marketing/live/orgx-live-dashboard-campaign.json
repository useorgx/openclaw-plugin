  "target_audience": {
    "primary_icp": "Builders and operators shipping agentic workflows (founders, product/eng leads, ops leads) who need a single place to monitor agents, unblock approvals, and keep execution aligned.",

    "pain_points": [
      "Agent runs feel like a black box: you cannot quickly see what is happening, what is blocked, and what is next.",
      "Approvals and decisions get lost in chat tools, slowing execution and creating rework.",
      "Work tracking drifts: plans, tasks, and what agents are actually doing fall out of sync.",
      "When connectivity is flaky, events get dropped and you lose a reliable execution timeline.",
      "Teams want a low-friction setup (pairing or key) that works locally first, then scales."
