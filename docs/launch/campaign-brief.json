  "target_audience": {
    "primary_icp": "Technical founders, indie hackers, and engineering leads experimenting with agentic workflows in OpenClaw who want control and visibility as their agent runs scale.",
    "pain_points": [
      "Agent runs feel opaque: no shared view of what is happening, what is blocked, and what to do next.",
      "Context and decisions get lost between runs; continuity across sessions is fragile.",
      "Manual orchestration is brittle: launching agents, tracking progress, and enforcing quality gates is time-consuming.",
      "Costs and model choice get harder to manage as agent execution scales."

        "Real-time activity stream keeps execution state visible while agents run."

        "Spawn checks can enforce rate limits and quality thresholds before sub-agent execution.",
        "Automatic tiered routing (local/sonnet/opus) reduces cost and improves output quality for the task at hand."

        "Browser pairing stores a dedicated credential and runs first sync automatically.",
