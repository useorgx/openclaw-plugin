  "objective": "By 2026-02-14, drive 200 landing-page visits, 50 plugin installs, and 10 paid conversions to the $99/mo BYOK plan from OpenClaw users.",
  "positioning_one_liner": "Armor + Mission Control for OpenClaw agents: harness the chaos, press continue, ship.",
  "creative_primary_metaphor": "OpenClaw is the beast. OrgX is the harness/armor/cockpit.",
  "tone": "High-signal technical credibility with a playful, character-driven story. Avoid generic SaaS vibes.",
  "target_audience": {
    "primary_icp": "Technical founders, indie hackers, and engineering leads experimenting with agentic workflows in OpenClaw who want control and visibility as their agent runs scale.",
    "pain_points": [
      "Agent runs feel opaque: no shared view of what is happening, what is blocked, and what to do next.",
      "Context and decisions get lost between runs; continuity across sessions is fragile.",
      "Manual orchestration is brittle: launching agents, tracking progress, and enforcing quality gates is time-consuming.",
      "Costs and model choice get harder to manage as agent execution scales."

        "Use existing OrgX character set (Launch Captain, Control Tower, Engineering Autopilot, etc.) as the narrative wrapper for real product capabilities.",
        "Posts anchor the story to a real artifact: Mission Control GIF + live dashboard screenshots."

      "pillar": "Quality gates and model routing built-in (real ops, not vibes)",
