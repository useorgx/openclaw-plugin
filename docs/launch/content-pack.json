      "content": "# Mission Control for OpenClaw Agents: the OrgX Integration\\n\\nIf you are experimenting with agentic workflows, you quickly hit the same wall: execution becomes hard to reason about. You can launch agents, but you cannot easily answer: what is done, what is blocked, what is next, and what decisions are pending?\\n\\nOrgX is built to make agent execution legible. The OpenClaw plugin brings that into your local OpenClaw instance: orchestration, quality gates, model routing, and a live Mission Control dashboard.\\n\\n## What you get\\n- Mission Control: Initiative -> Workstream -> Milestone -> Task\\n- Dependency-aware next-up queue\\n- Live sessions + activity stream\\n- Spawn checks (quality gate) + model tier routing\\n- Offline-safe reporting with outbox replay\\n\\n## Install + connect\\n1. Install:\\n   openclaw plugins install @useorgx/openclaw-plugin\\n2. Open:\\n   http://127.0.0.1:18789/orgx/live\\n3. Click Connect OrgX and approve pairing at useorgx.com.\\n\\n## Why this matters\\nWhen you can see the work, you can improve the system. Mission Control turns agent runs into something closer to operations: a backlog, a control plane, and an audit trail of what happened and why.\\n\\n## Next steps\\nIf you want to try it, start here: https://useorgx.com/integrations/openclaw?utm_source=devto&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=openclaw_launch&utm_content=devto_article\\n\\nFeedback welcome.
